# ML Repository overview

in this repository I practiced implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Perceptron
Perceptron - a simple machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. In the context of animals based on 10 factors (e.g., animal characteristics), the perceptron can be trained to classify observations into different classes (e.g., animal species).

## Backpack Problem
Backpack Problem - a combinatorial optimization problem where one must select a specific set of items given limited resources (e.g., backpack capacity or budget) to maximize value (or minimize weight).

## Single-Layer Network for Language Identification
Single-Layer Network for Language Identification - a machine learning model that uses a single layer of neurons to determine the language of a text input provided in the terminal. The network processes the input and classifies it based on learned patterns specific to different languages.
